![That's Me](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/368027?s=60&v=4) Hi, I'm Todd, These are my various projects.

## EH-WebComponents
Some simple [Web-Components](https://tdesposito.github.io/EH-WebComponents) you can drop into your site without a build process. No NPM, no Yarn, nothing. Just add tags to your HTML and away you go.

## pyZohoAPI
A Pythonic library for accessing the [Zoho Finance Suite API](https://pyZohoAPI.readthedocs.io)

## EH-mdServer
A [tiny webserver](https://github.com/tdesposito/EH-mdServer) which serves HTML, CSS, JS, images, and converts MD to HTML on the fly. Kinda like GitPages, but local and small.

## Pi-Appliance
A framework for building [Raspberry Pi appliances](https://github.com/tdesposito/Pi-Appliance)

## My Blog
[Cuz I guess that's cool again](https://toddesposito.com)

## I'm Available
I'm always looking for my next cool project, whether that be Open Source or a
paid consulting/development gig. Send me a note at [Todd@ToddEsposito.com](mailto://todd@toddesposito.com)
